security.txt

When security risks in web services are discovered by users they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported.

Security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for users to disclose security vulnerabilities securely. Include a text file on your server at .well-known/security.txt with the relevant contact details.
